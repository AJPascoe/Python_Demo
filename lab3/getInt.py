# Task 4 â€“ Input an Integer Between Two Limits
# In this part you'll ask the user to input an integer between a minimum and maximum values.
# 	If the user fails to enter an acceptable value for three times then you stop asking!
# 1.	Add a new file: getInt.py and make it the startup file.
# 2.	Create two variables for the min and max values. 
# Set two values for these variables such as 1 and 100.
# 3.	Write a while loop that attempts to get an integer from the user between the limits of min and max values.
# 4.	If the user has tried three times and fails then print None. 
# If a valid value is entered, just end the loop and print its value.

# Note: None is a valid keyword in Python which stands for Null.

min = 1
max = 100
i = 0  # user input counter

while i < 3:
    u = int(input(f"Pick a number between {min} and {max}: "))
    print(u)
    i += 1
    if u < min or u > max:
        print("Invalid number")
        break
    elif u == 5:  # u is the correct value 
        print(u,"is correct")
        break
    else:
        print("Try again!: ")
if i == 3: # if user reaches 3 attepts
    print(None)
